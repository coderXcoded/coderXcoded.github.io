         <h3>1. Robert Lewandowski</h3>
         <p>The Bayern Munich Forward has been ripping it up in the bundesliga. Its only a matter of time before he wins the ballon d'or. I believe this year is his year</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="messi">
         <img src="#">
         <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
         <p>Lionel Messi just like Robert Lewandowski has been lighting up La Liga. La Pulga has proven once more that he is a force to be Reckoned with.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="haaland">
         <img src="#">
         <h3>3. Erling Braut Haaland</h3>
         <p>The new king of hat tricks? Who knows. This 19yr old switched leagues and still cant stop Scoring. A force to be reckoned with? You bet!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="de_bruyne">
         <img src="#">
         <h3>4. Kevin De Bruyne</h3>
         <p>This is one player i really think is under appreciated. Talk about an all round player, Kevin De Bruyne is the man. The only person whose passing teqnique seems to surpass that of Players like Tony Kroos, Luka Modric and Paul Pogba</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="rashford">
         <img src="#">
         <h3>5. Marcus Rashford</h3>
         <p>Most people wouldnt agree to this but hear me out. Marcus Rashford hasn't played a single game for Manchester United for 3 months. Any idea what the gap between him and the Top Scorer is? 5 Goals. Yes you heard that right. His contributions to Manchester United have been incredible and we cant wait to see more of him soon</p>
